# Batch edit

Allows to view or edit specified attributes for the specified subsets of rows in the current table. If all of the values
in the column are the same, that value is shown in the corresponding field.

Use the "Rows" combo box to choose the subset of rows to edit:

* All
* Filtered
* Selected
* Selected or Current
* Filtered Selected
* Mouse Over Group
* Current Row
* Mouse Over Row

Depending on the "Rows" value, this control can also be used not only for editing, but for viewing the values of the
mouse-over row, or editing the values of the current row. \
