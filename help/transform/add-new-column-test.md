# Tests: Add new column

[Adds a column](add-new-column.md) of the specified type to the current table, and initializes it using the specified
expression (mathematical function, constants, platform objects properties and functions).

## Testing scenarios

1. Open *"demog"* table

1. Open [*"Add new column"*](add-new-column.md) dialog by clicking corresponding icon on toolbar

1. Enter *"test_column"* to *"Name"* field

* Column name changed to *"test_column"* in preview

1. Enter `1` to *"Formula"* field

* Type of new column is automatically determined as *int*
* All cells of new column were filled with value "1" in preview

1. Enter `1.5` to *"Formula"* field

* Type of new column is automatically determined as *double*
* All cells of new column were filled with value "1.5" in preview

1. Enter `test` to *"Formula"* field

* Type of new column is automatically determined as *string*
* All cells of new column were filled with value "test" in preview

1. Enter `true` to *"Formula"* field

* Type of new column is automatically determined as *bool*
* All cells of new column were filled with value "true" in preview

1. Enter `1+1.5` to *"Formula"* field

* Type of new column is automatically determined as *double*
* All cells of new column were filled with value "2.5" in preview

1. Forcibly change type of new column from *double* to *int* in *"Type"* field. (`1+1.5` entered in *"Formula"*
   field)

* New column type changed to *int*
* All cells values of new column rounded to 3 in preview

1. Change type of new column to *string* to *"Type"* field. (`1+1.5` entered in *"Formula"*
   field)

* New column type changed to *string*
* All cells of new column were filled with value "2.5" (*string*) in preview

1. Mark  *"Treat as string"* as true

* All cells of new column were filled with value "1+1.5" (*string*) in preview

1. Re-open [*"Add new column"*](add-new-column.md) dialog

1. Add "Height" column to *"Formula"* field. Enter ```$``` to call drop-down list of columns or drag column from
   anywhere in platform ([Column Manager](../explore/column-manager.md)
   , [Table](../overview/table.md),
   [Properties panel](../overview/navigation.md#properties))

* Type of new column was automatically defined as *double* (*"Height"* column type)
* Values ​​of new column are equal to values ​​of *"Height"* column in preview
* *"Name"* field is automatically filled by entered in *"Formula"* field

1. Enter `$HEIGHT+${WEIGHT}` to *"Formula"* field

* Each row of new column is equal to sum of corresponding rows of *"Height"* and *"Weight"*
  columns

1. Add constant value to *"Formula"* field (PI, E, LN2, LN10, etc.)

* Values ​​of new column are calculated depending on values ​​of entered constants

1. Use math functions in  *"Formula"* field (Abs(), Acos(), Min(), Max(), Log(), etc.)

* Values ​​of new column are calculated depending on entered funtions

1. Add columns of different types. Use different combinations of column types and entered values ​​in formula.

1. Remove some values ​​from each type of column. Use columns containing empty cells in *"Formula"*
   field

* For math operations with empty cells, they must remain empty in new column

1. Enter non-correct formula in appropriate fields

* Preview is empty
* `OK` not active for clicking

1. Register new function `norm2`(*) using JavaScript (**Tools | Scripting | JavaScript**)

1.

Enter `(norm2(Demo:DemoScripts:BMI($HEIGHT, $WEIGHT), $AGE)+norm2(Demo:DemoScripts:BSA($HEIGHT, $WEIGHT), $AGE))*100`
to *"Formula"* field and execute dialog

* New column added to table witch result of entered formula
* Added column has the name "New Column" (when you enter long formula, name is not auto complete)

1. Test non-functional modules (UI, help, navigation, console, history)

* [Add new column Auto Test](add-new-column-test.side)

(*):

```
grok.functions.register({
       signature: 'double norm2(double x, double y)',
       run: (x, y) => Math.sqrt(x / y)});
```
