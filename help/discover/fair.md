# FAIR principles

Datagrok's mission is to connect data, algorithms, models, analysis, and visualizations all together.

_From [go-fair.org](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/): In 2016, the
[FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)
were published in Scientific Data. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability
(i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human
intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in
volume, complexity, and creation speed of data._

## Findable

The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and
computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an
essential component of the FAIRification process.

### F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

### F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by r1 below)

### F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

### F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

## Accessible

A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

### A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

### A1.2 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

## Interoperable

The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or
workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

### I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation

### I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow fair principles

### I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

## Reusable

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described
so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

### R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

#### R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

#### R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

#### R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
