# Principal component analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of
observations of possibly correlated variables
(entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables
called principal components.

## Perform pca

* Open a table
* Run from the top menu: `ML | Principal Component Analysis...`
* Select the source table
* Select `feature` columns
* Set the number of principal `components`
* Set `Center` and/or `Scale` data pre-processing options
* Run principal component analysis

The result will replace all missing values in all columns and rows.
