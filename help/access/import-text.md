# Import text

Use this feature for finer control of the import options, as well as text editing.

Any changes made to the text or to the options are automatically applied, unless 'Auto sync' option is off. The preview
of the data is in the bottom pane.

Datagrok tries to auto-detect parameters automatically, so vast majority of the datasets can be imported by simply
dragging that file into the browser window, or opening it via the **File | Open (
Ctrl+O)** command.

Options and commands:
