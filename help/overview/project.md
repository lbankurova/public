# Project

Project is a collection of entities along with the applied visualizations. Projects are used to group and share data and
other assets with other users. One of the most common applications of projects are dashboards that consist of tables (
with either static or dynamic data), and visualizations applied to them.

## Uploading a project

Creating a project is easy. After getting the data of interest in the scratchpad project in [workspace](workspace.md),
click on the `UPLOAD` button. After the project gets uploaded to the server, a separate window pops us asking you whom
to share the project with. By default, it is only accessible by you, you have to share it in order for others to use it.

Or, if you are editing an existing project, click `SAVE` to save your changes.

Use `Share` context action to edit access permissions. Sharing a project will automatically share all entities and data
inside.

### Dynamic data

Whenever a table is created by executing a [function](../overview/functions)
(such as a [database query](../access/data-query.md)), this information gets stored with the table as a "generation
script". This serves multiple purposes:

* Provides data lineage
* On-demand data refreshing (Table toolbox, "Query" panel, `REFRESH` button)
* Enables publishing dashboards with the dynamic data

In the "Upload project" dialog, a "Data sync" option appears next to the tables that have a generation script defined.
This option determines whether the data should be stored as a static snapshot, or as a generation script. In the latter
case, the function will be re-executed whenever the project is opened.

## Project types

Projects are organized in a tree structure. Rights on particular [entities](objects.md) are inherited based on this
hierarchy. There are two main types of projects: _root_ and _regular_. Root projects can contain one or more non-root
projects, for example, the link `Demo:CoffeeCompany`
indicates that the `CoffeeCompany` project is part of the root project `Demo`. Any link to an entity on the platform
starts with the root project. And since an entity can have only one canonic address, other related projects will
reference the link rather than the entity itself. This fact becomes important in the context of regular projects. As the
name suggests, they are the most common ones
(that's what users create by default). Entities from such a project belong to the higher-level namespace, which means
they are tied to the root project. To find out where an entity comes from, see `Links` in the `Details` tab of the
property panel.

Root projects are automatically created for users and packages. When the user uploads a project, it gets saved to their
namespace. However, the existing entities will be available in the user's project via link. As for packages, each
version has its own project, which allows sharing packages on a version level.
