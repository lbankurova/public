# Navigation

This article is designed to help you navigate the Datagrok platform. We will introduce core concepts and walk you
through the fundamentals of working with our platform.

First of all, you need to launch Datagrok. Assuming that you are going to work with a public instance of the platform,
all you need to do is to open our website
([https://datagrok.ai/](https://datagrok.ai/)) and hit the `LAUNCH` button. This will lead you to the _Sign-Up/Login_
form.

The first thing you will see after launching the platform is Datagrok's welcome page:

![Welcome Page](../uploads/navigation/main-page.png "Datagrok's Welcome Page (Public Version)")

Here you can find an overview of the platform's key capabilities as well as the links to our
[Wiki](https://datagrok.ai/help), [Community Forums](https://community.datagrok.ai), Tutorials,
[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPHEjOd4gyZ6m6Ji-iOBYg),
[API Samples](https://public.datagrok.ai/js), browse a gallery of publicly available
[projects](project.md) and more.

The welcome page consists of several visual components: a sidebar, [toolbox](#toolbox), main
view, [property panel](#properties), and [context help](#context-help). Typically, the view resides in the center
and occupies all available area in the screen. The sidebar and toolbox are placed on the left. The sidebar contains
controls over the main functionality, while the toolbox displays options specific to the current view. The property
panel and context help are docked to the right. This appearance is fully customizable, you can manage the displayed
windows from the sidebar
(`Windows`), or turn them on/off with the following shortcuts:

|    Menu Option         |      Shortcut               |         Action                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Windows | Toolbox      | Alt + X                     | Show/hide the toolbox         |
| Windows | Properties   | F4                          | Show/hide the property panel  |
| Windows | Context Help | F1                          | Show/hide the context help    |

In addition to the design modularity, these panels can be resized and docked.

Now, let's proceed to the sidebar icons and explore the functionality they offer.

## Data

This tab brings together the platform's main data-retrieving capabilities. There are multiple ways in which you can work
with data in Datagrok: from a full in-browser experience to establishing data connections, deploying interactive
applications, running data jobs, building pipelines. It all starts with a simple step
of [importing data](../access/importing-data.md).

### Local files

Take a local file to begin with. To open it on the platform, drag-and-drop it into the browser. Other options include
file dialog interaction: double-click on the `Data` icon or press `Ctrl + O`. You can access this dialog from the
toolbox as well (`Data | Open local file`). It is important to note that the data resides in the browser up until the
moment you choose to upload it to the server. This is always done explicitly. See the list
of [supported file formats](../access/importing-data.md#supported-file-types)
and read more about [saving data to the server](../overview/project.md#uploading-a-project).

### File browser

[File shares](../access/file-shares.md) are arguably an even more popular choice for working with data. Files form a
hierarchy, which you can browse naturally from the interface. The
[File Browser](https://public.datagrok.ai/files) operates as a file system: you can organize pieces of data into folders
and subfolders, rename and move files. The [tree map](../visualize/viewers/tree-map.md)
component indicates how much space different files occupy in a shared folder, similar to disk partitions. Once the user
selects a file, this area changes to a preview where, depending on the extension, you may see a table, image, or text.

[//]: # (![]&#40;../uploads/navigation/file-browser.png "File Browser"&#41;)

The ribbon menu on top contains icons that highlight open views (a caret pointing down), control item
selection (`Select all`, `Select none`, `Invert selection`), update the file view (`Refresh`)
and toggle previews (`File preview`).

Every user has a special `HOME` directory to store their files. For convenience, it is created by default so that users
can start working with it right away. In addition, there are several ways to set up a new file share. First of all,
users can do that from `Data | Files | Actions | New File Share`. Besides, since shares are essentially data
connections, they can be added in the connection dialog (`Databases | Actions | Add New Connection`)
. If you enable indexing feature, the platform will extract metadata from the files, which you can later apply in the
search. The articles on
[data access](../develop/how-to/access-data.md#file-shares), [file shares](../access/file-shares.md)
and
[routing](routing.md#files) explain in more detail how to work with file shares.

### Databases

In Datagrok, you can retrieve data from a variety of sources. The platform comes with data connectors
for [30+ popular databases](../access/data-connection.md#connectors), and the list is constantly growing. In addition to
that, it is possible to develop your own data connectors, and seamlessly integrate them into the platform.

[Connections](../access/data-connection.md) to data sources live
in [Connection Tree](https://public.datagrok.ai/connect), which you can reach from `Data | Databases`. Each branch
corresponds to a provider and unfolds to show connections to the given data source. Connections, in their turn,
list [data queries](../access/data-query.md)
and, if available, [tables](../access/db-table-info.md) from the database.

### Webservices

### Queries

### Text

## Functions

## Manage

## Tables

## Favorites

## Projects

## Windows

The `Windows` icon lets you manage windows and see the currently open ones. In particular, you can customize the
visibility of the following panes: [Menu](#menu), [Tables](#tables),
[Columns](#columns), [Properties](#properties), [Toolbox](#toolbox), [Variables](#variables),
[Console](#console), [Context Help](#context-help). To save your preferences regarding the display of certain windows at
startup, tweak your user's [general settings](https://public.datagrok.ai/settings/general)
(`Settings | General`).

### Menu

### Columns

### Properties

This panel describes the properties of a current object. Typically, whenever the user clicks on most objects within the
platform, such as a table, data connection, application, command, or any other
[supported object type](../overview/objects.md), this object becomes a current object. So, to focus on one, simply click
on it. After that, you will see the corresponding property panel as well as the
[context help](#context-help).

`F4` toggles the visibility of the property panel. Additionally, you can manage it from the sidebar
(`Windows | Properties`). There are several useful icons in the panel header:

|      Icon        |            Action                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Back/Forward     | Navigate the history of previously viewed object properties |
| Clone and detach | Detach a copy of the property panel preserving the content  |
| Collapse all     | Collapse all listed property values                         |
| Favorites        | Switch to the properties of favorite objects                |

The property panel saves history of viewed objects, so you can switch to the previous selected object if necessary. This
also means that the content of the property panel is synchronized with the current object. To display properties of
another object along with the currently selected one, click on the `Clone and detach` icon.

The content of a property panel is generated based on the type of a current object, as well as its value. For example,
if you open a table, you can find applicable actions,
[predictive models](../learn/predictive-modeling.md), and algorithms. The panel is designed in such a way that related
objects are easy to reach, e.g., having a query in front of their eyes, users can identify the corresponding data
connection and switch to its properties with one click.

Some visual components, such as viewers, activate the property panel in a special way. To access the properties of a
viewer, you would click on a gear icon `âš™` in the top right corner of the viewer's header.

What is more, the information provided for a current object can be expanded by means of
[info panels](../discover/info-panels.md). They work on a number of different things, e.g., files or cells in a grid.

### Toolbox

The toolbox located on the left shows the properties and actions available for the currently active view. You can toggle
its visibility with `Alt + X` or `Windows | Toolbox`. In addition, the icons on the top right let you pin or close the
toolbox.

The toolbox contents change in accordance with the current view and extend its functionality, e.g., for a table view it
will show visualizations and filters, applicable models and layouts.

### Variables

`Alt + V` opens a variables view, which contains all variables available in the current context, and allows manipulating
them. It is also possible to enable the variables view from the toolbox
(`Windows | Variables`) or from the [console](#console).

There are several ways for an object to appear as a variable:

* Direct assignment like `x = 5` in the [console](#console)
* [Drag-and-drop](../overview/drag-and-drop.md) an object to the variables view

![Variables](../uploads/navigation/variables.png "Variables View")

The view consists of four fields describing the variables: `name`, `value`, `type`, and `semantics`. The last field
contains the semantic type, or quality, of a column value detected out of the box or as per custom semantic type
detection rules.

### Console

Console can be used to call [functions](functions/function.md) and record [macros](functions/function.md#macros).

#### Controls

|     Key     |    Action             |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| Tilde `~`   | Open the console      |
| Tab         | Complete a command    |
| Up/Down     | Previous/next command |

Press the tilde key `~` to open the console or enable it from the toolbox (`Windows | Console`).

![Autocomplete](../uploads/gifs/console-autocomplete.gif "Console Autocomplete")

Two icons on the top left let you clear the console, or open the [variables view](#variables). Clicking on the function
name will bring up its details in the [property panel](#properties).

#### Command examples

Run the `Mul` command (multiply two numbers) with the specified parameters:

```
Mul(2,3)
```

Edit parameters of the `Mul` command and evaluate it in a dialog window:

```
Mul
```

Get help for the `Mul` command:

```
Mul?
```

Access the current object from the console with the `o` variable:

```
o.name
```

Select rows with empty values in the `HEIGHT` column:

```
SelectRows("demog", IsNull("HEIGHT"))
```

Extract rows with empty values in the `HEIGHT` column into a new dataframe:

```
ExtractRows("demog", IsNull("HEIGHT"))
```

#### Recording macros

Every visual transformation within the platform is backed by a corresponding function, which provides for automatic
logging. Whenever a function is executed, the call gets logged in the console. No preliminary action is required on your
part, so you can seamlessly have it both ways:
use the console to examine which functions got triggered by particular UI events to reproduce those steps in the future,
or call functions on your data directly from the console. The first case can be used
in [data transformations](../transform/recipe-editor.md)
and [data pipelines](../access/data-pipeline.md). The second use case is a common practice for debugging custom
functions defined in a [package](../develop/develop.md#packages).

![Recording Macros](console-macros.gif "Console Macros")

### Context help

Context help appears at the bottom right and shows additional information about objects you are currently working with.
You can toggle this pane with the `F1` hotkey or manage it from
`Windows | Context Help`. It is enabled by default to help you navigate the platform and get the hang of its core
components.

While thorough explanations can be found in our documentation, the main purpose of contextual help is to provide you
with concise cues along the way. To learn more about a topic of your interest, make use of the icons available at the
top left:

|      Icon                |            Action             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Back/Forward             | Navigate visited pages        |
| Home page                | Open Wiki's home page         |
| Clone and extend to view | Open a page in the main view  |
| Open in new tab          | Redirect to the Wiki page     |

## Settings

Client-side settings are specific to the user, and are controlled by the user (unless the organization's IT policy
overrides this).

To edit client settings, open `Settings` from the sidebar.

![Settings](settings.png "Settings")

## User profile

Click on your user image on the sidebar to open the [user profile](../govern/user.md#profile). Here you can find a
summary of your data, read notifications, change your password,retrieve API and developer keys. The data on your
activity is provided by the platform's internal [audit system](../govern/audit.md).

## Help

The help section at the bottom left resets the toolbox options to the ones you typically see on the welcome page.

If an error occurs during any operation, you will be notified with the corresponding error message under the help
section. In this case, you can open the `Inspector` tool (via an exclamation mark `!`
icon or by pressing `Alt + I`) to further investigate the issue.

If you run into any difficulties, please refer to our [documentation](https://datagrok.ai/help) or ask a question in
our [community forums](https://community.datagrok.ai). Quick access to these links, as well as other useful resources,
is provided in the toolbox of the help icon.
