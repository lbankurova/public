# Widgets

Widgets are various Datagrok UI elements that together comprise the platform's user interface. For instance, an
Accordion pane on the left of the screen, a menu, a Balloon tooltip, or a Progress indicator are all widgets.

You can create custom widgets and provide them to Datagrok as [packages].
