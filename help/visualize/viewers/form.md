# Form

Form allows you to customize the appearance of the row by manually positioning the fields, and adding other visual
elements, such as pictures or panels. A form can be used either as a stand-alone viewer, or as a row template of
the [Tile Viewer](tile-viewer.md).

## Editable forms

To edit values via the form, click on the 'edit' icon on top.

## Built-in form designer

To reposition the fields, click on the 'presentation' icon, and then drag-and-drop fields to the new locations. To
change visual properties of an element, click on it while in the designer mode; properties will appear in
the [property panel](../../overview/navigation.md#properties)
on the right.

Field color-coding and format are picked up from the corresponding grid, if possible.

The following keyboard shortcuts work only when the form is in both read-only and presentation modes:

|                           |                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| <, left or up             | Previous row           |
| > , right or down          | Next row               |
| Space                     | Toggle selected state  |
