# 3D Scatter plot

Use 3D scatter plot to plot data points on three axes to show the relationship between three variables. Each row in the
data table is represented by a marker whose position depends on its values in the columns set on the X, Y, and Z axes.
Additionally, you can color-code and size-code points, as well as display labels next to markers.

Controls:

|                           |              |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Right click               | Context menu |
| Mouse Wheel Up or Plus    | Zoom in      |
| Mouse Wheel Down or Minus | Zoom out     |
| Click                     | Make current |
